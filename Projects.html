Monte Carlo simulations, also known as the Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of stochastic algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling, which are mainly used in three problem classes: inverse problem (optimization), numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event (see Fig. 1). For instance, to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models, Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. Monte Carlo simulations let us to analyze all the possible outcomes of the decisions and assess the impact of risk, allowing for better decision making. Furthermore, mathematical formulation of many physical and biological systems contains parameters that are typically unknown or known only with large uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with unknown parameters translates into an uncertainty in model prediction, consequently, in hypothesis evaluation, which itself significantly affects decision-making processes. Moreover, dynamic models involve latent variables, which cannot be measured directly, hence requiring inference from latent space (abstract representation of a real-world system) to understand the emergent dynamics of a complex system. Bayesian inference is a principled method for statistical inference that updates the prior belief about a hypothesis with new evidence from observed data, thus naturally characterizing uncertainty over unknown quantities. Bayes rule provides a formal way of combining prior information (domain expertise before seeing data) with the likelihood function (data generative process) to form the posterior of events, which encodes all the relevant information for inference and prediction on unseen data. This probabilistic methodology provides an estimation of unknown quantities by incorporating the uncertainty or variation in assumptions, (unmeasured) latent variables, (measured) observations, and algorithmic error/predictions.

In the context of clinical trials, using Frequentist approach, prior information (based on clinical evidence from previous trials) is utilized only in the design of a trial but not in the analysis of the data. On the other hand, Bayesian approach provides a formal mathematical framework to combine prior information with available information at the design stage, during the conduct of the experiments, and at the data analysis stage.

Computational modeling allows us to simulate real-world systems, thus learning about the data generation process, making predictions on unseen data, and justifying the hypotheses. By running various simulations with different inputs, we can gain insight into different potential outcomes, thus providing evidence to support or refute hypotheses regarding the effects and mechanisms of a certain phenomenon. In contrast to forward modeling, which is a top-down approach, model inversion (e.g., simulation-based inference) is a bottom-up strategy that infers hidden causes from observed effects. Having various source of information and system spatio-temporal scales, the Bayesian inference provides a unified framework to merge the models, data, prior information and algorithms to reach reliable scientific conclusion.  This approach allows for the incorporation of uncertainty and prior knowledge in the hypothesis testing process (such as anatomical data, MRI lesion, the target of stimulation or evidence from previous trials on drug efficacy, etc), which is important for understanding the underlying causes of diseases, hence to improve the predictions for better decision-making processes at the individual and group levels.

Monte Carlo methods to perform Bayesian inference (inverse problem) involves the following steps:
<br style="line-height: 10px" />
1) Analyzing and better understanding the data to extract relevant and low-dimensional features, which can be modeled/fitted.
2) A Bayesian model of the data generating process, i.e., a statistical model where the probability is used to represent both the uncertainty regarding the output and the uncertainty regarding the input (i.e., parameters or latent states) of the model. In contrast to black box methods, this step requires knowledge about the model components such as hierarchical dependencies in probabilistic model, identifying both dependent variables to be predicted and independent variables that will drive the prediction, as well as specifying prior probability distribution on all unobserved variables/parameters.
3) Implementation of the Bayesian models in a computer program to sample from the posterior. The efficiency of sampling critically depends on both data and model (the calculation of the likelihood function). Running Monte Carlo methods typically requires a large number of model evaluations, which demand powerful computer resources and high-performance computing. In high dimensional parameter spaces, the higher the number of samples on Monte Carlo methods, the better is the approximation, subsequently, they have a large demand on computational resources.


The use of cloud computing for parallel computing offers some advantages over conventional clusters: high accessibility, scalability and pay per usage. Facility Hubs can provide access to supercomputing
network and cloud computing for data storage, analysis, simulation, and running Monte Carlo algorithms in parallel.
4) Algorithmic convergence, diagnostics, and validation. Once the model is fitted, it is necessary to assess the convergence to the “true” stationary solutions that help ensure high accuracy and quality decision making. The convergence diagnostics specific to the used algorithm, and posterior behavior analysis (e.g., posterior predictive check), and out-of-sample prediction are necessary to validate the reliability of the model estimations.
